# DigiPi Plus
## Add additional functionality to KM6LYW DigiPi

You can find the DigiPi image here https://digipi.org/

You will need at least a 16gb SD Card that has been expanded to use the entire disk for a full install.  This is mainly due to Grid Tracker, which requires more than 1.3gb. You can learn how to expand the filesystem [here.](extend_filesystem.md)

## Known Issues
RTL-SDR will cause an error to occur on **Raspberry Pi 4** that looks like `rtlsdr_read_reg failed with -7` and `rtlsdr_write_reg failed with -7` when running Direwolf, or with OpenWebRX showing the device as inactive. There is an error in the firmware regarding the USB ports and communicating with the RTL-SDR. To fix, the firmware will need to be upgraded.
